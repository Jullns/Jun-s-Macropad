## Challenges:

In this project, I learned a lot about using KiCad and Fusion, finally bringing the Macropad project to life. My biggest challenge was Fusion, as I had never used 3D design software before. I had to follow many steps to create the case; however, by following tutorials and doing research, I successfully completed the project and gained a great deal of knowledge.
